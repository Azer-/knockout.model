class @Employee extends KnockoutModel

    constructor: (defaults) ->
        @id = KO ""
        @name = KO ""
        @surname = KO ""
        @fullname = KO (-> @name() + " " + @surname()), @
        @birth_date = KO ""
        @address = KO ""
        @phone = KO ""
        urls =
            "get": "http://#{window.location.host}/employees"
            "post": "http://#{window.location.host}/employees/post"
            "put": "http://#{window.location.host}/employees/put"
            "delete": "http://#{window.location.host}/employees/delete"
        super(defaults,urls)

        @name() isnt "" and @surname() isnt "" and @birth_date() isnt "" and
                @address() isnt ""

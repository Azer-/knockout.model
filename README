# Employee model
class @Employee extends KnockoutModel

    constructor: (defaults) ->
        @id = ko.observable ""
        @name = ko.observable ""
        @surname = ko.observable ""
        @fullname = ko.dependentObservable(-> @name() + " " + @surname()), @
        @birth_date = ko.observable ""
        @address = ko.observable ""
        @phone = ko.observable ""
        urls =
            "get": "http://#{window.location.host}/employees"
            "post": "http://#{window.location.host}/employees/post"
            "put": "http://#{window.location.host}/employees/put"
            "delete": "http://#{window.location.host}/employees/delete"
        super(defaults,urls)

    validate: ->
        @name() isnt "" and @surname() isnt "" and @birth_date() isnt "" and
                @address() isnt ""
